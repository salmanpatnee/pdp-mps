## Scale/Scope for Manuscript Submission System

### Decision:
The system should initially support up to 10,000 active users and 50,000 manuscripts, with a growth potential to scale to 100,000 users and 500,000 manuscripts over 3 years.

### Rationale:
This scale aligns with typical academic journal platforms and provides a reasonable target for initial development and infrastructure planning. It balances immediate needs with future growth, avoiding over-engineering for initial launch while ensuring scalability.

### Alternatives considered:
- Smaller scale (e.g., 1,000 users, 5,000 manuscripts): Rejected as it would quickly become insufficient for a growing platform.
- Larger scale (e.g., 1M+ users): Rejected as it would require significant upfront investment in infrastructure and complex architectural decisions that are not necessary for the initial phase.
